Titles' generation of job vacancies (RNN-LSTM)

I started this project out of an idea for my master thesis in which I planned to examine the influence of Covid-19 at the job market in Germany. But later I decided to change the topic of my master thesis. At this point I have already scraped about 40 thousand online job offers from one of the largest online job platforms in Germany â€“ Stepstone. The data was scraped from its public website. The dataset consists of 12 columns. All rows consist of text information with two exceptions an id column and time column. The data is saved as json format. As a result, I decided to use this data set to develop my coding abilities in Python and my ML knowledge. The task I decided to fulfil was the generation of job titles based on previous knowledge, namely: the X-features are job descriptions and job profiles, and the Y-feature are job titles.
